## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- **Book Club website** ðŸ“š: creating a digital platform for our Book Club. Iâ€™m developing tools for sharing reviews and insights, including a book generator and a central hub for discovering new reads.

- **PhysioReact**: building a modern website for a (fictional) physiotherapy clinic. Weâ€™re adding features like an easy-to-use reservation system and a simple contact form, all done with my team. Weâ€™ll soon be focusing on enhancing reservation management.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- **React and TypeScript** to improve our projects, and Iâ€™m focusing on enhancing the design to a friendlier and more eye-catching user experience.
